      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many years (on/off) I&amp;rsquo;ve rented dedicated servers from the likes of OVH. This has many advantages over typical shared VPS hosting as your processes don&amp;rsquo;t need to compete for CPU time with other tenants on the hypervisor. At the start of the year however, I decided to build my own Home Server and move away from a rented solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
